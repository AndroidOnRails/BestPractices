Some **best practices** categorized by app development platform we are using at Jamit Labs.

The goal of this project is both to **provide many articles to cover independent topics** using a typical blogpost-like
length and to provide a book-like structure meaning that **articles are sorted to reflect their topics relevance**
regarding the stage of the projects development and/or the programmers learning progress.

This has two main advantages:

- articles can be read **on-demand** (meaning: when they are needed) and work well as **reference**
- beginners can **acquire knowledge step by step** by following the articles structure
